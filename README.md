This is the repository for my website:
[https://CryptoidCoder.github.io/Coding-Website/](https://CryptoidCoder.github.io/Coding-Website/)

This is a place where all of my projects can go, so they can be easily viewed by people.


I will buy the domain `CryptoidCoder.co.uk` And this will be on the subdomain of `Shop.CryptoidCoder.co.uk`
- When this happens I need to change the home URL link ***from*** `https://CryptoidCoder.github.io/Coding-Website/` ***to*** `/`
